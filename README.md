This repository contains a job portal app using MERN.

Here a user can find and search jobs.
The recruiter can post the jobs.
Here, I have added some filters, so that the user can filter the jobs on the basis of salary, type of job, experience level and location.

The user can upload resume in the portal.

The user can login and without login also, they can use.
